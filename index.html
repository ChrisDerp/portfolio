      <h2>About Christopher</h2>
      <p> All of my life I've been fascinated by computers, even going as far as building my very own. My fascination was not limited to the physical attriubtes of PC's, but to the software itself and how they ran . Such as how websites, computer applications, and even how software ran.</p>
      <p> I've always been able to get along great with others at school, while working on project, and I find myself thriving while working with others.</p>
